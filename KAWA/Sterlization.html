                    of male and female dogs thus ceasing their reproductive capacity. It also helps them to live a long

                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are all aware of the massive surge in the
                    population of the feral dogs in India which has led to the emergence of the following problems:
                </p>
                <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • FIGHTS OVER FOOD</h5>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shortage of food often leads to the dogs engaging
                    in ferocious fights amongst themselves and in some instances humans getting accidently bitten end up
                    as victims in the act. </p>
                <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • FEMALE DOGS WITH NEW BORN PUPPIES</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presence of newly born pups often induces the
                    maternal instinct in the parent sometimes making them aggressive towards people who knowingly or
                    unknowingly get very close to her pups. The new generation of small children who are extremely fond
                    of animals often end up getting bitten when they try to play with the pups. </p>
                <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • MATING</h5>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Male dogs who have a desire for mating often turn
                    aggressive to compete for a female mate during the reproduction season and may end up accidently
                    biting people.</p>
                <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • RABIES</h5>
                <p > &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A fatal disease sometimes present in dogs which can
                    be transmitted to humans via bites.</p>
                <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • HUMAN ANIMAL CONFLICT</h5>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The above mentioned problems often end up in
                    dog-human conflicts subjecting dogs to abuse involving culling, beating and relocation.</p>

                <h3>3. SOLUTION</h3>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sterilization has proven to be an effective,
                    scientific and humane approach to control the feral dog population. It deals with the surgical
                    procedure of removing the reproductive organs of the male and female dogs making them incapable of
                    mating and further breeding.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This proves to be effective in reducing their
                    fights, accidental bites and preventing the birth of new litters. Sterilizing just one female dog
                    halts the birth of hundreds of pups. Considering these aspects, it is necessary to conduct animal
                    birth control surgeries on a large scale. Dogs undergoing this procedure are vaccinated against
                    rabies, thus ensuring that they get protected against the disease and prevent the risk of
                    transmission to humans.

                <h3>4. STERILISATION PROCESS</h3>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is important to understand that sterilization is
                    a gradual process and a sudden change cannot be expected.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surgeries are carried out by the Municipal
                    corporation and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) with the help of keen and enthusiastic animal
                    welfare volunteers. Unsterilized dogs are identified by municipal catchers and volunteers and they
                    further assist in their captures and moving them to the sterilization centers. Sterilized dogs can
                    be easily identified by a V- shaped notch on one of the ears. Considering the enormity of the
                    problem, active participation of citizens in identifying unsterilized dogs in their local areas and
                    reporting it to the concerned volunteers or municipal authorities would be indeed very helpful and
                    highly appreciated
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Volunteers will then deal with habituating the dogs
                    by using means of food which will thus make the job of capturing the animal for the surgery a lot
                    easier. People willing to participate in these activities are also encouraged to join and help the
                    volunteers and government authorities.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Post-sterilization, the dog will be released again
                    in his native territory. This will help in keeping the population of that area in check. Relocation
                    will not be done as dogs in the neighbouring areas being territorial by nature will often end up in
                    fights with the relocated ones resulting in injuries to people and increasing the chances of
                    human-dog conflict. Relocation is not the answer as vacant spaces in a territory are immediately
                    occupied by new home-seeking unsterilized dogs which will only amplify the problem of reproduction
                    resulting in new litters in that area. Sterilizing, vaccinating and release in their respective
                    areas are thus the most feasible and effective solutions to control new births and reduce the
                    human-dog conflicts in the future.

                <h3>5. HOW CAN YOU HELP ?</h3>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Participation of citizens in awareness programmes
                    will help spread the message of animal welfare and related activities to a larger section of the
                    population. Donations to NGOs or area volunteers for sterilization drives will largely help in
                    increasing the efficiency of the process and conduct it on a bigger platform.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We further request the people not to pressurize the
                    municipal catchers to pick up sterilized dogs, lactating mothers and pups under 6 months of age.
                    Doing this will only worsen the ongoing situation. The dogs will be sterilized at the preferred time
                    once the mother stops lactating and pups are over 6 months of age.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Citizens are also requested not to stop the
                    catchers from picking up unsterilized dogs. There have been several instances where people have
                    interfered and objected the process by arguing with the catchers and have prevented them from
                    executing the necessary captures.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly, it is important to understand that in the
                    current-world scenario, we need to co-exist and live in harmony with the street animals in our
                    surroundings. We believe that even these animals are entitled to live a happy and peaceful life and
                    share the surroundings with us. Dogs, as many of you may know are known to be man's best friend and
                    they display this carrying out their duty of protecting their as well our territory at night and
                    thereby preventing problems like thefts.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is also necessary to show a feeling of empathy
                    towards them. Every year, several dogs and cats become victims of road accidents either killing them
                    or leaving them handicapped for life. Many die due to starvation due to limitation of food and water
                    resources. In the view of this, we request all citizens to come forward, cooperate and extend their
                    support in reporting unsterilized dogs in their areas on our website.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our sterilization coordinators will get in touch
                    with you and try to help at the best of their ability.
